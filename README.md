# CANDY MARKET SHARE ANALYSIS



## Project Overview
The objective of this Power BI report is to analyze and visualize comprehensive market data from a leading European market research company specializing in the confectionery industry. The dataset includes detailed information on major manufacturers, their brands, packaging, and sales volumes in a specific regional market.

## Problem Statement
Over the past two years, the confectionery market has witnessed significant shifts in sales dynamics and consumer preferences. A leading European market research company seeks to leverage a data-driven approach to understand the current market landscape and its evolution between 2022 and 2023. The objective is to provide actionable insights that will support strategic decision-making for major manufacturers in the confectionery industry.

## Process
`Data Preparation`
- The initial phase involved performing data cleaning tasks, including the removal of null values, the elimination of unnecessary columns, handling duplicates, and adjusting data types to ensure data quality.

`Data Modeling`
- The subsequent step was to create calculated measures and tables using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI, enhancing the dataset's analytical capabilities.

<pre><code>
  # Calculated Total Sales 
Total Sales = SUM('Table3'[SALES VOLUME  in EUR])
 
  # Created Year-Over-Year Sales to compare sales performance from 2022 to 2023
 YoY Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Table3[Date])
)
  
  # Calculated Year-Over-Year Growth Rate
 YoY Growth Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    ([Total Sales] - [YoY Sales]),
    [YoY Sales]
)
</code></pre>

`Data Analysis`
- Following data modeling, an in-depth data analysis was conducted within Power BI, utilizing various visualization techniques like matrices to identify trends in sales, category-wise performance, manufacturer details, and product insights. This analysis provided actionable insights into market dynamics and supported strategic decision-making.

`Dashboard Creation`
- The project proceeded with the development of an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard was designed to include bookmark features and filters, allowing for seamless navigation and personalized views across various charts and visualizations. These tools provided a more comprehensive and tailored view of the data, enhancing the overall user experience.


## Dashboard 
The dashboard section offers an array of visualizations that empower users to explore and understand sales data. Key features of the dashboard include:

- Visualization of Monthly and Yearly Sales Trends: Interactive charts showcasing sales trends over different periods.
- Comparison of Sales Across Different Categories: Detailed comparisons of sales by product type, packaging type, manufacturer, brands, items, and distribution channels.
- KPIs: Key Performance Indicators such as revenue, sales volume, year-over-year sales, year-over-year growth rate, and items sold.

i previously created other two bookmarks for switching then how to sepeate this
To manage multiple bookmarks and ensure that the reset button works independently of other bookmarks used for switching, you can organize and set up your bookmarks effectively. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Create Distinct Bookmarks for Each Function:

Ensure each bookmark has a unique purpose and is named clearly to avoid confusion.

Example bookmark names:

"Reset to Default"

"View 1"

"View 2"

Using Separate Buttons for Different Bookmarks:

Insert individual buttons for each bookmark action.

For example, one button for "Reset to Default", one for "View 1", and one for "View 2".

Configure Each Buttonâ€™s Action:

Select each button and go to the "Format" pane.

Expand the "Action" section.

Set the action type to "Bookmark" and choose the corresponding bookmark for each button.

Detailed Steps:
Organize Your Bookmarks:

Go to the "View" tab and select "Bookmarks".

Ensure your bookmarks are named clearly:

"Reset to Default" for resetting filters and visuals to default state.

"View 1" and "View 2" for other analyses or views.

Insert and Configure Buttons:

Insert a button for each bookmark:

Go to the "Insert" tab.

Click on "Buttons" and choose a style.

Place the button on your report.

For the "Reset" button:

Select the button.

Go to the "Format" pane.

Expand the "Action" section.

Set the "Action" to "Bookmark".

Choose the "Reset to Default" bookmark.

Repeat for other buttons ("View 1" and "View 2"), linking each to the appropriate bookmark.

Test Your Setup:

Hold the CTRL key and click each button to ensure they correctly switch views or reset the report as intended.

Example Button Labels:
"Reset"

"Analysis View 1"

"Analysis View 2"

By setting up your bookmarks and buttons this way, you ensure each button performs its designated action without interference, making your report more user-friendly and efficient.

Steps to Clone a Repository:
Navigate to the Repository:

Go to the GitHub repository page you want to clone. For example, https://github.com/yourusername/candy-market-share-analysis.

Copy the Repository URL:

Click the green "Code" button on the repository page.

Copy the URL provided (either HTTPS or SSH).

Open Your Command Line Interface (CLI):

Use a terminal, command prompt, or Git Bash.

Run the Clone Command:

Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL.

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/candy-market-share-analysis.git
Navigate to the Repository Folder:

After cloning, navigate to the repository folder on your local machine.

bash
cd candy-market-share-analysis
What Cloning Does:
Copies All Files: It creates a local copy of all files and folders in the repository.

Preserves Version History: It retains the complete version history of the repository.

Links to Remote: It links your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub, allowing you to pull updates and push changes.

Why Clone a Repository:
Work Locally: Perform tasks and make changes to the project on your local machine.

Version Control: Benefit from Gitâ€™s version control features to track changes and collaborate with others.

Sync Changes: Push your changes back to GitHub, where they can be reviewed and merged into the main project.

This process is essential for collaborative projects and makes it easy to manage and sync code between multiple contributors.

If you need further assistance with this process, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

is it necessary for me like i have to publish my project here
Publishing your project on GitHub isn't strictly necessary, but it does have several benefits:

Benefits of Publishing on GitHub:
Version Control: Track changes to your project over time, making it easier to manage and revert changes if needed.

Collaboration: Collaborate with others by sharing your project, allowing for contributions and feedback.

Backup: Keep a backup of your project in the cloud, ensuring it's safe and accessible from anywhere.

Portfolio: Showcase your work publicly, which can be valuable for job applications or sharing with clients.

Open Source: Contribute to the open-source community by making your project available to others.

Alternatives:
Local Storage: Keep your project on your local machine or use a local Git repository for version control without publishing.

Private Repositories: Use private repositories on GitHub (if you have a plan that supports it) to keep your project private while still benefiting from GitHub's features.

Summary:
While not mandatory, publishing your project on GitHub can provide numerous advantages, particularly in terms of collaboration, version control, and portfolio building. However, if you prefer to keep your project private or stored locally, thatâ€™s perfectly fine too.

If you decide to publish, feel free to reach out for any assistance with setting up your repository! ðŸ˜Š

i asked about cloning..
Ah, got it! You donâ€™t necessarily need to clone your repository unless you want to work on it locally. Cloning is particularly useful if you plan to:

Make changes to your project offline and then push those changes back to GitHub.

Collaborate with others who will also be making changes.

If You Decide to Clone Your Repository:
Go to Your Repository Page:

Navigate to your newly created repository on GitHub.

Copy the Repository URL:

Click the green "Code" button on the repository page.

Copy the URL provided (HTTPS is most common).

Open Your Command Line Interface (CLI):

Use a terminal, command prompt, or Git Bash.

Run the Clone Command:

Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/candy-market-share-analysis.git
Navigate to the Repository Folder:

After cloning, navigate to the repository folder on your local machine:

bash
cd candy-market-share-analysis
Benefits of Cloning:
Local Development: Work on your project offline and take advantage of powerful local development tools.

Version Control: Keep track of changes with Git, making it easier to collaborate and manage updates.

Backup: Have a local copy of your project as a backup.

If Cloning is Not Necessary:
Use GitHub Web Interface: You can directly add, edit, and manage files using GitHub's web interface without cloning the repository.

Upload Files Manually: For one-time uploads or small changes, you can use the "Upload files" button on the repository page.

Cloning is a powerful feature, but itâ€™s not always required. It depends on how you plan to work on your project. If you need any more help or decide to clone your repository, let me know! ðŸ˜Š

Would you like more details on how to collaborate with others using GitHub, or any specific features of GitHub you'd like to explore?

i my self created a project and its completed so whats the point of cloning
If your project is complete and youâ€™ve already uploaded it to GitHub, cloning might not be immediately necessary for you. However, there are still some potential benefits to consider:

Benefits of Cloning Your Repository:
Local Backup: Having a local copy of your repository ensures that you have a backup of your project on your computer.

Offline Access: Work on your project without needing an internet connection. Any changes can be pushed to GitHub once you're back online.

Further Development: If you plan to continue developing the project or make future updates, cloning allows you to do this efficiently.

Version Control: Keep track of any changes or improvements you make over time. This is especially useful if you decide to revisit or expand the project in the future.

When Cloning Isnâ€™t Necessary:
Completed Projects: If the project is entirely complete and you donâ€™t anticipate making any further changes, you might not need to clone it.

Minimal Changes: For small, infrequent updates, you can use GitHub's web interface to make those changes directly.

Ultimately, cloning is a powerful tool for ongoing development and collaboration but may not be essential for a project that is already finalized and doesn't require further updates.

If you decide to work on the project again in the future or collaborate with others, cloning can be very helpful. Otherwise, you can manage your project directly on GitHub using its web interface. If you need further assistance or have any more questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
